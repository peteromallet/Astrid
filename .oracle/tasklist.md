# Canonical pack beta — authoritative execution tasklist

Status: **frozen for execution; E0 cloud preflight in progress**

Authorities: `.oracle/agent_goal.md`, `.oracle/northstar.md`, and
`.oracle/implementation-ledger.md`.

This is the single remaining-work list for the canonical-pack goal created in
this conversation. It replaces unrelated storyboard residue and the overgrown
historical plan. A checked item means this worktree contains direct evidence;
**REUSE** means working base functionality to preserve, not progress delivered
by this run.

## Megado execution controls

- This is a **huge run** because the best estimate is 4–6 engineer-weeks.
- Every B1–B5 implementation task is classified **normal**, assigned to the
  user-selected GPT-5.6 Luna. No task currently satisfies the exceptional
  `[XHARD]` threshold. GPT-5.6 Sol owns oracle adjudication and any future
  exceptional task only after a written threshold finding.
- Each batch inherits the criteria and North Star alignment stated at its
  heading. Each execution brief embeds the complete North Star and digest.
- After each implementation candidate, freeze its artifact/diff identities and
  obtain three independent Luna verdicts. Any `REWORK` blocks progress. After
  Luna converges on `PASS`, obtain one Sol oracle disposition, then commit the
  reviewed batch as its checkpoint. No dependent work consumes an unpassed
  checkpoint.
- B2 and B3 checkpoints remain unshipped and legacy-active. They do not create
  an active dual reader; B4 is the only activation checkpoint.
- Huge-run cumulative gate 1 occurs after passed B3 and before B4 activation.
  It reviews B1–B3 together for contract, manifest, database-projection, and
  cutover readiness.
- Huge-run cumulative gate 2 occurs after passed B4 and before B5. It reviews
  B1–B4 together for the integrated hard cut and absence of dual authority.
- B5 routine/final review remains separate. Only its final passed checkpoint
  may be pushed; no checkpoint is merged, deployed, promoted, or released.

## P0 — project control and evidence baseline

- [x] P0.1 Prepare the canonical-pack packet in the dirty source checkout
  without changing product files.
- [x] P0.2 Create the isolated worktree and `megado/canonical-pack-beta` branch
  from exact base `7ac50c12`.
- [x] P0.3 Freeze the North Star and 15-criterion goal.
- [x] P0.4 Complete ten accepted Luna repository-exploration areas.
- [x] P0.5 Complete Sol planning/revision/stability work through revision 9.
- [x] P0.6 Complete seven three-Luna settled-plan waves and adjudicate the
  non-clean Wave 7 findings into the reduced beta scope.
- [x] P0.7 Verify zero product diff and the inherited behavior floor, including
  a 179-test focused substrate pass.
- [x] P0.8 Reconstruct the actual conversation/worktree history and create the
  implementation ledger and this tasklist.
- [x] P0.9 Apply the final independent clarity-oracle corrections and pass the
  repository/doc truth check.

P0 is planning, research, and custody. It satisfies none of the 15 final
product criteria by itself.

## E0 — execution-environment preflight

- [x] E0.1 Reclaim sufficient disk space before B1 implementation. The final
  truth check found only about 145 MiB free and a Python heredoc could not
  create its temporary file. Cleanup requires a separate, explicitly approved
  disk survey/action and is not canonical-pack product work.
- [x] E0.2 Prove at least **3 GiB free** on `/System/Volumes/Data`, successful
  creation/removal of an ordinary temporary file, and successful creation of
  an isolated Python environment directory. Record commands and results before
  dispatching B1.
- [ ] E0.3 Complete cloud-venue custody: unique workspace/container/session,
  exact base bundle plus complete `.oracle` overlay with recorded SHA-256/file
  count/size, zero product diff after restoration, and registration in the
  canonical AgentBox durable operations ledger.
- [ ] E0.4 Prove the isolated cloud container's Python/git/OMP tooling, Luna and
  Sol routes, push dry-run, dependency install, focused baseline behavior, disk
  capacity, and protection of every pre-existing container/workspace before
  dispatching B1.

## Inherited behavior floor — preserve, do not rebuild

- **REUSE:** the frozen-but-not-deeply-immutable `PackDefinition` shell, v1
  parser/validator/scaffolding, layered discovery, provenance, and typed
  executor/orchestrator/element/rendering/generation projections.
- **REUSE:** external capability install/update/rollback/uninstall, revision
  storage, locks, aliases/forks/overrides, and trust inspection.
- **REUSE:** strict schema-manifest validation, immutable collision registry,
  dependency ordering/cycle checks, exact-byte checksums, drift refusal,
  read-only probes, and per-migration transactions.
- **REUSE:** `DatabaseWriter`, `UnitOfWork`, typed repositories/services,
  events, receipts, hashes, and conformance patterns.
- **REUSE:** timeline, shots, references, and Runaway SQL/product behavior.
- **REUSE:** application/SDK/read wiring, doctor, backup/restore, and the
  installed-artifact test harness.
- **REUSE:** 17 direct product-pack skills and `_core` guidance.

## Cutover invariant

B1 is contract/fixture work only. It must not activate strict v2 against the
current v1 bundled tree. B2, B3, and B4 form **one unshipped atomic cutover
tranche**:

- before activation, only the legacy capability/schema authorities are active;
- during the tranche, new behavior is exercised through isolated fixture roots
  and explicit injection;
- activation happens only after all 22 bundled manifests and all consumers are
  ready; and
- after activation, only canonical v2 is active. There is no dual loader,
  compatibility shim, or shippable dual-database-authority checkpoint.

## B1 — freeze and prove the v2 contract in isolation

Goal criteria: 1, 2, 6, 12, 13.

Classification/alignment inherited by B1.1–B1.10: **normal — Luna**. Advance
one identity/grammar/parser/catalog, confined resources, bundled-only database
trust, direct hard cut, and reuse of typed machinery. Avoid shims, dual reads,
hidden schema-pack reuse, external SQL, and speculative lifecycle machinery.

- [ ] B1.1 Freeze one strict JSON Schema with integer `schema_version: 2` and
  only `pack.yaml` as its filename.
- [ ] B1.2 Evolve the existing model into one deeply immutable canonical entry
  containing identity, normalized definition, provenance/source/root,
  capabilities/extensions, optional database contribution, documentation, and
  confined resource handles.
- [ ] B1.3 Make static validation and the new catalog use one strict
  read-normalize-validate path.
- [ ] B1.4 Reject v1, alternate filenames, missing/defaulted identity, legacy
  flat mappings, unknown fields, traversal, and symlink escapes.
- [ ] B1.5 Freeze the optional `database` grammar: explicit `default_enabled`,
  ownership/vocabulary, repositories/conformance/static mounts, migrations,
  and dependencies expressed as pack ID plus a **positive minimum migration
  head**. Detailed DDL remains in SQL.
- [ ] B1.6 Freeze structured documentation and narrowly declared
  `runtime_resource` entries with owner-root confinement.
- [ ] B1.7 Build a deterministic catalog over an explicitly supplied fixture
  root; parse each manifest once and expose narrow typed capability, database,
  resource, and documentation projections.
- [ ] B1.8 Add golden capability-only, database-only, and combined v2 fixtures,
  plus invalid legacy/path/dependency fixtures.
- [ ] B1.9 Add a positive external capability-only v2 pack that succeeds via
  each supported external discovery/install path. Add otherwise-equivalent
  external packs with `database` for local, extra, environment, and installed
  sources, and prove rejection occurs before SQL/resource resolution.
- [ ] B1.10 Keep the production runtime pinned to the captured legacy baseline;
  add no temporary dual reader or compatibility code.

Gate B1: the final v2 contract and isolated catalog are proven, including
external admission behavior, while the active bundled runtime is unchanged.
Three independent Luna reviews and one Sol oracle disposition must pass; then
commit the reviewed B1 checkpoint.

## B2 — prepare all 22 canonical product packs

Goal criteria: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13. Begins the unshipped atomic tranche.

Classification/alignment inherited by B2.1–B2.9: **normal — Luna**. Advance
one canonical ownership declaration, complete structured docs/resources, the
direct cut, and proportionate beta scope. Avoid compatibility aliases,
unclassified surfaces, fake `_core` symmetry, and exhaustive ownership
machinery.

- [ ] B2.1 Delete the empty `builtin` pack and all 59 deprecated alias shims.
- [ ] B2.2 Convert the 18 retained capability manifests to v2 without losing
  any of 64 executors, 12 orchestrators, 10 elements, or the typed
  rendering/generation projections.
- [ ] B2.3 Add v2 `pack.yaml` to `timeline`, `shots`, `references`, and
  `runaway`, merging their database declarations without changing SQL or
  product semantics.
- [ ] B2.4 Preserve explicit defaults: timeline/shots/references enabled,
  Runaway disabled but explicitly composable.
- [ ] B2.5 Make `references` the combined capability/database/SDK/CLI/docs
  exemplar while preserving its three-table and command/event behavior.
- [ ] B2.6 Give **all 22 retained product packs** direct structured guidance.
  Add skills for blender, timeline, shots, references, and Runaway; use no
  bundled-pack documentation opt-out. The general grammar may retain a
  justified opt-out for a future truly internal pack.
- [ ] B2.7 Generate the `_core` 22-pack census and links to every owning skill;
  keep `_core` as code-owned guidance/kernel, not a fake product pack.
- [ ] B2.8 Produce a lightweight customization coverage ledger covering pack,
  capability/extension, database, CLI/SDK/bridge, documentation, operational,
  and `runtime_resource` ownership, ending with zero unclassified surfaces or
  unjustified kernel owners.
- [ ] B2.9 Inventory the known typed component/rendering loaders and explicit
  pack-relative file reads. Every known runtime resource must be declared or
  justified as kernel-owned; do not attempt exhaustive all-file/Python
  ownership.

Gate B2: all 22 bundled product manifests, docs, and known runtime resources
are ready in v2 under the unshipped cutover branch. Three independent Luna
reviews and one Sol oracle disposition must pass; then commit the reviewed B2
checkpoint while legacy runtime authority remains active.

## B3 — project canonical databases through the existing engine

Goal criteria: 4, 5, 6. Continues the unshipped atomic tranche.

Classification/alignment inherited by B3.1–B3.9: **normal — Luna**. Advance
SQLite authority, SQL-owned DDL, existing migration/writer/UoW reuse, confined
resources, and manifest-derived composition. Avoid duplicate state, YAML DDL,
general SQL observers, project locks, and premature legacy deletion.

- [ ] B3.1 Project canonical database declarations into the surviving
  immutable collision/migration machinery through explicit catalog injection;
  do not delete production legacy builders yet.
- [ ] B3.2 Replace the code-created core `SchemaPackManifest` with an explicit
  irreducible kernel database/vocabulary projection; keep core non-unloadable.
- [ ] B3.3 Carry owning pack, owner root, and confined migration resource handle
  on every migration descriptor instead of rebuilding `astrid/packs/<id>`.
- [ ] B3.4 Enforce the B1 dependency grammar by comparing every declared
  positive minimum migration head with the dependency pack's available head.
- [ ] B3.5 Derive default composition only from bundled entries with
  `database.default_enabled=true`; derive explicit Runaway composition through
  the same projection.
- [ ] B3.6 Preserve `schema_migrations` as the sole applied-state record and
  preserve checksums, drift/order/transaction semantics, writer/UoW,
  repositories, and conformance behavior.
- [ ] B3.7 Verify each bundled migration affects only declared owned tables
  with focused fresh-schema assertions, not a generalized SQL observer.
- [ ] B3.8 Add fresh-default, existing-reopen, explicit-Runaway, read-only
  pending, dependency/head/cycle, collision, checksum/name drift, and rollback
  tests.
- [ ] B3.9 Replace historical Runaway-demo dependencies with a deterministic
  temporary-project round trip; never restore or package the missing demo.

Gate B3: injected catalog-derived default and extended database projections
are green while production authority remains legacy until B4 activation.
Three independent Luna reviews and one Sol oracle disposition must pass; then
commit the reviewed B3 checkpoint. Run cumulative gate 1 over B1–B3 and require
three fresh Luna passes plus one Sol disposition before B4 begins.

## B4 — converge consumers and activate the atomic hard cut

Goal criteria: 2, 4, 7, 9.

Classification/alignment inherited by B4.1–B4.8: **normal — Luna**. Advance one
catalog-derived projection for all consumers and the direct deletion of
alternate authorities while preserving typed registries. Avoid a universal
service locator, dual reads, hidden schema-pack identity, dynamic factories,
or bypassing operational consumers.

- [ ] B4.1 Construct the bundled catalog/database projection at a top-level
  application or operation seam and pass typed projections to consumers.
- [ ] B4.2 Move all seven independent builder consumers: application, SDK
  invocation, kernel reads, timeline edit helpers, doctor, backup/restore, and
  rendering/media assets.
- [ ] B4.3 Move the direct `domain_product` CLI mount reader; preserve explicit
  typed service/repository/static CLI/bridge factories.
- [ ] B4.4 Preserve the single lock/writer, exact SDK registry propagation,
  read-only, backup/restore, and current product semantics.
- [ ] B4.5 Extend pack inspect with stable text/JSON canonical identity/source,
  capability summary, database ownership/head, documentation, and declared
  resource closure.
- [ ] B4.6 Extend doctor with the bundled census, docs/resource health, and
  expected/applied/pending migrations. Doctor must not consume the offline
  coverage ledger or scan Python ownership.
- [ ] B4.7 At one atomic activation point, switch runtime admission to strict
  v2, delete all four `schema-pack.yaml` files, remove both
  `STANDARD_SCHEMA_PACKS` tuples and `_STANDARD_PACK_DIRS`/raw schema-manifest
  reads, and remove the separate schema-pack identity/parser/standard path
  after relocating reusable algorithms.
- [ ] B4.8 Prove there is no active dual authority, no raw manifest reread, and
  no independent standard-registry build.

Gate B4: only canonical v2 is active; all operational consumers agree on one
ordered projection; there is no shippable dual-authority state. Three
independent Luna reviews and one Sol oracle disposition must pass; then commit
the reviewed activation checkpoint. Run cumulative gate 2 over B1–B4 and
require three fresh Luna passes plus one Sol disposition before B5 begins.

## B5 — closure, wheel proof, and final review

Goal criteria: 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15.

Classification/alignment inherited by B5.1–B5.9: **normal — Luna**. Advance
wheel-complete confined resources/docs, canonical inspection, zero legacy, and
evidence-backed completion. Avoid declaring success with bypasses, creating an
evidence platform, or reopening marketplace/lifecycle scope.

- [ ] B5.1 Verify zero v1/flat/alternate loaders, `schema-pack.yaml`, fixed
  tuples, raw identity reconstruction, alias shims, compatibility-only tests,
  or active docs teaching old forms remain. Legacy deletion occurred in B4;
  B5 does not defer it.
- [ ] B5.2 Update package data for all 22 v2 manifests, four migration trees,
  all 22 pack skills/docs, `_core` census, and every declared runtime resource.
- [ ] B5.3 Compare the declared runtime-resource set in source and wheel and
  prove every declared handle resolves within its owner root.
- [ ] B5.4 Update authoring, database, SDK/CLI, inspect, doctor, backup/restore,
  and agent-facing docs to teach only the final form.
- [ ] B5.5 Prove at least **5 GiB free**, create an isolated validation/build
  environment, install and record the version of `build`, then build one clean
  wheel. The current missing local `build` module is a preflight dependency,
  not a waived criterion.
- [ ] B5.6 Run clean outside-checkout wheel checks for help, catalog,
  docs/resources, fresh DB, doctor, default composition, and explicit Runaway.
  Re-run the positive external capability-only v2 install/discovery case from
  the installed-wheel lane.
- [ ] B5.7 Run focused pack/database/data-pack/consumer/docs tests and the full
  authoritative suite once; classify only reproducible unrelated baselines.
- [ ] B5.8 Produce a concise 15-row evidence matrix mapping each frozen goal
  criterion to commands, results, artifacts, and reviewer disposition.
- [ ] B5.9 Obtain three independent Luna final verdicts and the final
  independent Sol oracle disposition; commit the reviewed B5 checkpoint and
  push `HEAD:refs/heads/megado/canonical-pack-beta` only after the gate. Earlier
  passed batches already have their own reviewed commits. Do not merge, deploy,
  or release.

Gate B5: 22 canonical packs; zero legacy authority; three-pack default plus
explicit Runaway; complete source/wheel docs and resources; green tests; final
independent pass.

## Explicit exclusions

- per-project pack/revision composition lock;
- enable/disable/purge or database-aware uninstall lifecycle;
- third-party SQL/database packs;
- installed-record/revision-store redesign or Python byte attestation;
- operation-snapshot/TOCTOU/tamper-evidence program;
- marketplace, signing, sandbox, dependency solver, or permissions UI;
- dynamic repository/service/CLI/bridge factory framework;
- exhaustive all-file/Python ownership or runtime audit-ledger consumption;
- generalized SQL/table observer or bespoke evidence platform;
- compatibility shims or a dual-read period; and
- the follow-on `astrid update` project until this cutover passes.

## Progress truth

- Existing Astrid package/product foundation: **substantial and mostly built**.
  Eighteen of 22 target product directories already have v1 capability-pack
  manifests; all 64 executors, 12 orchestrators, and 10 elements are already
  domain-discovered; 17 of 22 product packs already have direct skills; all
  four database-backed slices and their migration engine are operational.
- Clarity/reconciliation control work: **P0 9/9 complete**.
- Canonical-v2 implementation batches: **0/5 complete**.
- Frozen final criteria satisfied in canonical form: **0/15**.
- Product files changed by this run: **zero**.
- Remaining estimate: **4–6 engineer-weeks** for one senior engineer.

Next action: clear E0, then execute B1 as isolated contract/fixture work and
B2–B4 as one unshipped atomic cutover tranche. Do not start another broad
planning wave.
