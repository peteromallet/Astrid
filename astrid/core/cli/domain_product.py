"""Product-family CLI registry (m4 plan step 24, task T25).

This module is the ownership authority for the product command census and
manifest mounts. It declares **exactly** the five product families —
``projects``, ``media``, ``tasks``, ``runs``, and the manifest-owned
``timelines`` — and attaches the two manifest-declared nested mounts
(``shots`` beneath ``timelines`` and ``references`` beneath ``media``)
from the explicit in-tree schema-pack manifests (``cli_mounts``).

Rules enforced before any dispatch (sense check SC25):

- **Missing mounts** — a required manifest declaration (timelines, shots,
  references) that the shipped manifests do not declare is rejected.
- **Duplicate mounts** — two declarations for the same family or the same
  mount path are rejected.
- **Unexpected mounts** — a manifest declaring a family outside the frozen
  declarations, or a declared family at a different path, is rejected.
- **Dynamic mounts** — the loader reads only the three fixed in-tree
  manifests (``astrid/packs/{timeline,shots,references}/schema-pack.yaml``);
  there is no discovery, no scanning, and no injection point, so a mount
  from any other source is impossible by construction.

The product census also excludes the operational commands (``serve``,
``doctor``, ``backup``): they are never part of the five-family product
registry, help, or product dispatch.

The dispatch boundary (:func:`run_product_family`) composes one
``AstridClient`` and passes it to the family's in-tree parser builder, so
every product handler is a rule-free SDK adapter (m4 plan step 24).
