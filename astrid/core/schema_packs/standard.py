"""Kernel-side standard schema-pack composition (core + four in-tree packs).

The standard-Astrid registry is the composed expectation used by schema
validation (``doctor`` schema_versions, backup restore validation). Kernel
modules (``astrid/core/**``) must be able to build it **without importing
``astrid.packs``** — the single documented kernel-to-pack composition
exemption is the gateway serve root
(``astrid/core/gateway/dispatch.py``) — so this kernel composition registers
the core vocabulary and loads the four in-tree schema-pack manifests from
the installed package tree. ``astrid.packs.build_standard_registry`` keeps
its own pack-layer implementation (the ``STANDARD_SCHEMA_PACKS`` literal
there is required by the deterministic pack-factoring surgery); this module
is the kernel-side counterpart with the same explicit pack enumeration.
