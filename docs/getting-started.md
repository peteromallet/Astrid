# Getting Started with Astrid

Astrid is a Python SDK and harness toolkit for building and running
agentic UXes — pipelines where agents and humans collaborate to make art.

## Prerequisites

Astrid requires Python 3.11+. The runtime is a separate local service that
owns durable workspace state; the Astrid checkout is a client and pack source,
not the state store.

Install Astrid and configure the installed neutral launcher with an explicit
source-profile manifest. The first product command starts or reconnects that
runtime through the neutral launcher; no separate database service is needed:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install .
python3 -m pip install 'banodoco-workspace-runtime @ git+https://github.com/banodoco/banodoco-workspace-runtime.git@4050394c5395206f1ec6bf0d905ffbfb7bb0e4de'
export BANODOCO_LOCAL_SOURCE_MANIFEST=/path/to/astrid-source-profile.json
python3 -m astrid --help
python3 -m astrid projects list --json
```

### Optional Hivemind pack

Astrid pins the Hivemind v2 delivery commit through the explicit
`ASTRID_HIVEMIND_REVISION` seam. The delivery checkout has a concrete
immutable pin; the canonical remote must publish that commit before a remote
installation can use it. Until then, point `ASTRID_HIVEMIND_REPOSITORY` at a
local Hivemind checkout (or provide a complete local source declaration). Setup
validates the strict v2 pack manifest and composes its skill view; it fails
closed if the pinned object cannot be fetched rather than following `HEAD`:

```bash
python3 -m astrid.setup
python3 -m astrid.setup --check --offline
python3 -m astrid.setup --disable-pack hivemind
python3 -m astrid.setup --restore-pack hivemind
```

The delivery pin is already the complete 40-character Git object id. Override
`ASTRID_HIVEMIND_REVISION` only with another full immutable Hivemind object id,
and use `ASTRID_HIVEMIND_REPOSITORY` for a local mirror or checkout during
rehearsal. `ASTRID_SOURCE_DECLARATIONS` or `--declarations` remains available
for a complete local Git declaration. Skill sync is read-only with respect to
source acquisition; Hivemind corpus search and retrieval still require
network access. See the
[Hivemind external-pack contract](reference/hivemind-pack-contract.md) for
the v2 metadata, anonymous reads, and contributor-write routes.

Use that environment for later commands too. The render worker checks its
dependencies in an isolated Python process, so user-site-only installations
are insufficient; install rendering dependencies into the active environment.

The pinned source install is temporary until the certified
`banodoco-workspace-runtime==0.1.0` wheel is published. Astrid resolves the
launcher from an explicit override, then the `banodoco-local` script, then the
installed `banodoco_local` module through the current Python interpreter. An
installed runtime therefore still works when its scripts directory is absent
from `PATH`.

An existing neutral source manifest can be used instead with
`BANODOCO_LOCAL_SOURCE_MANIFEST`. The manifest records both editable
checkouts and is retained under the runtime support directory after a
successful first launch so later `banodoco-local restart`/reconnect commands
use the same composition. The equivalent explicit operator command remains
`banodoco-local up --profile astrid`.

## Your First Command

From any shell with the runtime configured, check health:

```bash
python3 -m astrid doctor --json
```

Other useful zero-secret commands:

```bash
python3 -m astrid projects list --json
python3 -m astrid projects show demo --json
```

After a project has a successful timeline render, verify and open the newest
runtime render on macOS with:

```bash
python3 -m astrid projects select demo
python3 -m astrid runs open
```

Pass a run id positionally (`runs open <run-id>`) to open an exact successful
render, or use `--project <project>` to override the current project. The
command does not guess from checkout filenames or modification times.

If using the SDK directly, pass the loopback runtime endpoint and credential to
`AstridClient.open(...)` together with the runtime realm and actor identity.
Never point Astrid at a local SQLite/CAS directory; the runtime owns those
details.

`astrid doctor` remains a read-only diagnostic and does not create support
state. Product commands perform the bounded neutral launch/reconnect handoff
through `AstridClient.open_from_launcher()`. Ordinary SDK
`AstridClient.open()` calls remain explicit and never launch a process.

The seven top-level gateway families are `projects`, `timelines`, `media`,
`tasks`, `runs`, `doctor`, and `backup`; `timelines shots` and `media
references` are nested mounts. `doctor`
and `backup` use runtime routes. Backup supports create/restore/export and realm
lifecycle operations, with `--json` for a machine-readable result.

Runtime health, project identity, media objects, timeline versions, task/run
state, receipts, and events are authoritative only in the workspace runtime.
The SDK never opens a local Astrid database or content-addressed store.

Historical pre-runtime project trees and local-store migration plans are not
part of the Stage1 live path. Preserve them as immutable source artifacts and
do not treat them as current workspace state; the product checkout has no
historical migration command or local-store writer.

For the complete project, timeline, media, recovery, and failure journeys,
continue with [CLI journeys](guides/cli-journeys.md). For renderer-specific
diagnostics, see [Debugging](guides/debugging.md).

### Canonical timeline schema

The canonical `banodoco_timeline_schema` package is an optional external
dependency. Astrid's default Python install intentionally does not vendor or
declare this private Banodoco workspace package, so clean installs can use the
non-schema surfaces and import Astrid without that checkout. Timeline document
validation, managed rendering/visualization, and the exact canonical-schema
parity assertions require it and fail closed when it is unavailable.

The `dev` extra pins a compatible public source revision so the repository-wide
test suite and CI validate one deterministic schema. This does not add the
schema to Astrid's base runtime dependencies.

Install the package from a compatible Banodoco workspace checkout with the same
interpreter used to run Astrid:

```bash
python -m pip install -e /path/to/banodoco-workspace/packages/timeline-schema/python
python -c "import banodoco_timeline_schema; print('timeline schema available')"
```

The Astrid checkout does not contain `packages/timeline-schema/python`; replace
the placeholder with the path to the external workspace. If the package is not
installed, timeline validation fails closed with the installation message above.

### First visible timeline render

When hand-authoring a timeline, start with root `clips`, a `visual` track,
structured text marked explicitly as `clipType: "text"`, and an MP4 output:

```json
{"tracks":[{"id":"cards","kind":"visual","label":"Cards"}],
 "clips":[{"id":"title","at":0,"track":"cards","clipType":"text","hold":2,
   "text":{"content":"HELLO ASTRID","fontSize":64,"color":"#ffffff","align":"center"}}],
 "output":{"resolution":"640x360","fps":30,"file":"title.mp4"}}
```

The renderer rejects a structured `text` clip without `clipType: "text"` and
checks the default `.mp4` output suffix before starting a render, so these
mistakes do not consume a failed attempt.
