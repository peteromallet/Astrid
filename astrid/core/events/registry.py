"""Core stream, event, and command vocabulary with independent registration.

(m1 plan step 2; m2 plan step 1.) The kernel registers its own vocabulary
independently of any Astrid pack: core declares the ``core.project``,
``core.task``, ``core.run``, and ``core.media`` stream types plus the m1/m2
core event/command kinds, and only then may the explicit standard-Astrid
composition in ``astrid/packs/__init__.py`` registers the four in-tree schema
packs (v10 section 2.3 law 5; decision artifact section 4).

Rules kept here:

- Vocabulary names are namespaced dotted names; the composed registry rejects
  missing, duplicate, or non-namespaced declarations before any database opens.
- The kernel has no ``schema-pack.yaml`` file: its manifest is code-declared by
  :func:`core_schema_pack_manifest` and reuses
  ``astrid.core.migrations.catalog.CORE_MIGRATIONS`` as the single audited
  source for the core migration descriptor, so registry table ownership and the
  migration runner can never drift.
- This module never opens a database and never imports the capability-pack
  loader, discovery, or definition machinery (v10 section 2 "Boundary now,
  loader later").
- Heartbeat deliberately gets no command or event kind: it is the narrow
  non-event attempt-liveness exception (v10 section 5.1), so no heartbeat name
  may ever appear in the core vocabulary.

``core.task``, ``core.run``, and ``core.media`` stream types are registered now
because v10 section 2.3 requires core to register its stream types; m1
implements the project vertical only, so m1 core event/command kinds are the
project ones. m2 (plan step 1) registers the exact task lifecycle (admission,
claim, start, expiry, cancellation, failure, retry, completion), run fan-out
and group, and media (import, location replacement, relations) command/event
kinds the m2 repositories consume. m3 (plan step 1) adds the receipt-linked
run continuation vocabulary (``core.run.continue``/``core.run.continued``),
the kernel evidence event (``core.evidence.recorded``) and its receipt
command kind (``core.evidence.record``), and registers
aggregate agreement rules for the references and shots packs' own stream
types (``reference.reference``, ``shot.shot``) so pack-owned repositories
can create and write their aggregate streams without kernel DDL changes.
